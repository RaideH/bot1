  "bot_description": "A Telegram bot that allows users to schedule messages to be delivered to themselves at specific times. Users provide both a message and a delivery time, and the bot delivers the message at the scheduled time. The bot supports both 24-hour and 12-hour time formats, automatically schedules messages for the next day if the specified time has passed, and provides comprehensive error handling and user feedback.",
  "client_instructions": [
    "Start the bot by sending the /start command to receive welcome instructions and learn how to use the bot",
    "Send a message in the exact format: 'message: Your message text, time: HH:MM' where you replace 'Your message text' with your actual message and 'HH:MM' with your desired delivery time",
    "Use supported time formats: 24-hour format (15:30, 15:30:45) or 12-hour format (3:30 PM, 3:30:45 PM, 3:30PM) - note that 12-hour format requires AM/PM designation",
    "Wait for confirmation message that shows your scheduled message and delivery time - this confirms your message was successfully scheduled",
    "Use /list command anytime to view all your currently scheduled messages with their delivery times",
    "Use /help command to see detailed instructions, supported formats, and examples if you need assistance",
    "Receive your scheduled message automatically at the specified delivery time - the bot will send it directly to you"
